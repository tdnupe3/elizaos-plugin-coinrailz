Overview

Robinhood Chain is built for tokenized real-world assets — and Robinhood Stock Tokens are our flagship real-world asset. Stock Tokens are tokenised debt securities issued by Robinhood Assets (Jersey) Limited ("RHJ"). The Product provides economic exposure to underlying securities like US shares and ETFs, but does not grant investors any legal or beneficial rights in, or against the issuer of, those underlying securities. Stock Tokens are issued as standard ERC-20 tokens that can be held, transferred, and composed into applications onchain.

For developers, this means programmable access to real-world assets using the same tools you already use for any ERC-20 — no special SDK required to get started.

## Why build with stock tokens

- **Programmable real-world assets**
- **Standard ERC-20 interface** — works out of the box with existing wallets, libraries, and tooling.
- **Onchain prices** — every Stock Token has a live Chainlink price feed, so your contracts can read prices directly onchain.
- **Composable** — build trading, lending, structured products, and more on top of real-world asset exposure.
- **Self-custodied and 24/7** — assets live in users' wallets and are accessible around the clock.

## What you can build

A few examples of what developers can build with Stock Tokens:

- List and display Robinhood Stock Tokens in a wallet, portfolio tracker, or trading interface.
- Enable trading.
- Build lending markets that use stock tokens as collateral.

See [Building with Stock Tokens](https://docs.robinhood.com/chain/building-with-stock-tokens) for use cases, integration patterns, and code.

## How Stock Tokens work

- Each Stock Token is a standard ERC-20 contract with 18 decimals.
- Each token corresponds to a specific underlying equity or ETF, identified by its ticker symbol.
- Prices are published onchain via per-asset Chainlink data feeds.

## Corporate actions & the multiplier

The platform manages dividends and stock splits through an onchain multiplier, which adjusts the shares-per-token ratio while keeping your raw balance static until redemption. You can access this value via the token's `uiMultiplier()` function, defined by [ERC-8056](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8056) (Scaled UI Amount Extension). Onchain swaps remain unaffected, and the oracle automatically incorporates the multiplier into the price (see [Oracles & Price Feeds](https://docs.robinhood.com/chain/oracles-and-price-feeds)).

## Disclaimer

Stock Tokens are ERC-20s issued by RHJ. RHJ also acts as the tokenizer. Only Authorised Participants (at issuance, the only Authorised Participant is BBVI) may subscribe for Stock Tokens directly from RHJ after KYB onboarding (the primary market), so developers build by composing with existing tokens rather than minting. For how holders acquire and redeem tokens.

Robinhood Chain supports moving assets through its canonical bridge plus several cross-chain routes from partners. The canonical bridge is the trustless default for moving funds between Ethereum and Robinhood Chain; the additional routes offer faster transfers and broader network coverage.

| Route | Type | Speed | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Arbitrum canonical bridge](https://portal.arbitrum.io/bridge?destinationChain=robinhood-chain&sourceChain=ethereum) | Trustless L1↔L2 | Deposit ~10 min · Withdrawal ~7 days (challenge period) | Move ETH and ERC-20s between Ethereum and Robinhood Chain |
| LayerZero OFT / [Stargate](https://stargate.finance/) | Messaging + Omnichain token (OFT) transfer | Minutes (varies with source-chain finality) | Fast token movement across chains, moving WBTC, USDG, and other OFTs |
| Chainlink CCIP / [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/?to=robinhood&tab=token) | Messaging + token transfer | Minutes (varies with source-chain finality) | Fast, secure cross-chain transfers and applications: move tokens & send messages (e.g. bridge SyrupUSDG and deposit it into a lending market) |
| [Relay](https://relay.link/bridge/robinhood) | Intents-based bridge | Seconds | Fast, low-cost transfers — and bridge-and-execute (trigger an action on the destination chain) in one step |
| [Across](https://across.to/?to=robinhood) | Intents-based bridge | Seconds | Fast, capital-efficient asset bridging across chains |
| [LiFi](https://li.fi/) / [0x](https://0x.org/) | Cross-chain swap aggregators | Seconds–minutes | Swap-and-bridge in one step |

## Canonical bridge

The canonical bridge is the native bridge for Robinhood Chain. It is trustless and requires no third-party validators — security is inherited directly from Ethereum.

### Depositing (Ethereum → Robinhood Chain)

Deposits typically confirm within 10 minutes. To bridge ETH or ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to Robinhood Chain, use the [Arbitrum canonical bridge](https://portal.arbitrum.io/bridge?destinationChain=robinhood-chain&sourceChain=ethereum)

**If a deposit doesn't arrive**

Deposits use Arbitrum's retryable ticket system. If the Robinhood Chain (L2) leg of a deposit fails — for example, due to insufficient gas — the funds are not lost. The deposit can be manually redeemed from the bridge interface within 7 days.

### Withdrawing (Robinhood Chain → Ethereum)

Withdrawing from Robinhood Chain is a three-step process:

1. Initiate the withdrawal on Robinhood Chain (L2).
2. Wait for the 7-day challenge period, a standard requirement of Arbitrum's fraud proof system.
3. Claim your funds by submitting a transaction on Ethereum (L1). This final step is required and incurs L1 gas costs.

### For developers

To bridge programmatically, interact with the Delayed Inbox contract on Ethereum L1. Contract addresses are available on the [Protocol Contracts](https://docs.robinhood.com/chain/protocol-contracts) page.

Note that a bridged ERC-20's contract address on Robinhood Chain differs from its address on Ethereum. To resolve the corresponding L2 address, call `calculateL2TokenAddress` on the L2 Gateway Router, or refer to the [Protocol Contracts](https://docs.robinhood.com/chain/protocol-contracts) page.
